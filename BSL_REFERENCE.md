## Practice Tips

### For Best Recognition:

1. **Lighting**
   - Face a light source
   - Avoid backlighting
   - Even lighting on hand

2. **Position**
   - Center of frame
   - 6-12 inches from camera
   - Keep hand steady

3. **Background**
   - Plain, contrasting color
   - No movement behind hand
   - Solid wall works best

4. **Hand Position**
   - Palm generally facing camera
   - Fingers clearly separated
   - Hold for 1-2 seconds

### Common Mistakes:

❌ Moving hand too quickly
❌ Fingers too close together
❌ Poor lighting
❌ Hand too close/far from camera
❌ Complex background

✅ Steady hand position
✅ Clear finger separation
✅ Good lighting
✅ Proper distance
✅ Plain background

## Letter Combinations

Practice these common combinations:
- HI
- YES
- OK
- BYE
- HELP

## Testing Your Setup

1. Start with easy letters:
   - S (fist)
   - B (flat hand)
   - V (peace sign)
   - L (L shape)

2. Move to moderate:
   - A (thumb across)
   - O (circle)
   - U (two fingers together)

3. Try difficult:
   - R (crossed fingers)
   - K (thumb between fingers)

## BSL vs ASL Differences

| Letter | BSL | ASL |
|--------|-----|-----|
| A | Fist, thumb on side | Fist, thumb on side (same) |
| B | Flat palm forward | Flat palm forward (same) |
| G | Index pointing side | Index and thumb parallel |
| H | Two fingers side | Two fingers side (same) |
| V | Two fingers apart | Two fingers apart (same) |

**Note:** Many BSL signs use two hands, which this version doesn't support yet.

## Troubleshooting Recognition

### If letter not recognized:

1. Check finger positions match diagram
2. Improve lighting
3. Hold sign longer
4. Try slight angle changes
5. Ensure no fingers are hidden

### Improving Accuracy:

- Practice each sign 10 times
- Use the trainer mode to create personal gestures
- Maintain consistent hand orientation
- Keep movements smooth and deliberate

## Next Steps

Once comfortable with fingerspelling:
1. Practice spelling common words
2. Try the training mode for better accuracy
3. Learn BSL grammar (different from English)
4. Consider learning full BSL (not just alphabet)

**Remember:** This is fingerspelling only. Full BSL uses handshapes, 
movements, locations, and facial expressions. Fingerspelling is just 
one small part of BSL!
